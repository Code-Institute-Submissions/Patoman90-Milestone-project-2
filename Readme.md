                                            Milestone project 2.

# Intro.

In this project I decided to make a HTML5 game for my front-end project using Canvas from HTML5, which allows me to create a game that works with Html5 technology mixed with javascript, to called different parts of data from a javascript file which makes the game interactive. My initial idea was to make a game that is a multi level side scroller. As this was my first game and I had no prior experience making a game, I decided a crossing style game is easier. In order to make up my mind on what I wanted to do though, I had to learn how to use Canvas in HTML5 and look at the capabiliies of the technology. I also had to learn how to use Javascript to make it work.

I wanted to make a game that is simple and not complex that demonstrates my javascript skills i learnt and other relevent technologies listed below that I either needed to use or chose to use in the project to achieve the desired outcomes. I hope this helps me to impress future employers to help me land my first job.

# UX and UI design goals.

My user experience goal with this project is to try make a game that has ease of use to play, with practical game controls so that the user can learn how to play quickly and not get frustrated or have a negative experience playing the game due to bad game control layout. I wanted to make a fun to play game that makes the user want to return and play again and again due to the ability to learn the timing of the enemies in the game to make it feel easy but tricky too. 
The game uses sprites and 2D graphics which would appeal to retro gamers and players who are used to playing older style games. Being the first game I ever made 3D is out of the question for now.
I wanted to make a game that evokes a positive response from the player due to the responsive gameplay and controls.
I also thought it would be good to use appropriate colors to make it visually stimulating and nice to look at.
It was also important to make sure that there were no bugs in the code as the user might have a bad ux if the game did not work properly and they lost the game as a result or worse the game crashed.
So in terms of avoiding that, I tried to consider defensive coding methods.
Another goal of this is to be playable by most ages of people and no language barrier ideally.

# Deployment

Website was coded in vscode.It was built with Html5 canvas, CSS3, Vanilla Javascript then I saved the documents on my laptop and then uploaded to GITHUB via git commandline into a remote repository from my local repository for assesment.
