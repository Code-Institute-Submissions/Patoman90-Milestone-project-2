In this project I decided to make a HTML5 game for my front-end project using Canvas from HTML5. It allows me to create a game that works with HTML5 technology mixed with javascript, to call different parts of data from a javascript file which makes the game interactive. My initial idea was to make a game using phaser.io but i thought i would learn more trying to use just canvas instead. First game idea was a multi level side scroller but it was too advanced for me so I made a crossing style game.  In order to make up my mind on what I wanted to do though, I had to learn how to use Canvas in HTML5 and look at the capabilities of the technology. I also had to expand on how to use Javascript to make it work.
I wanted to make a game that is simple and not complex that demonstrates my javascript skills I learnt and other relevant technologies listed below that I either needed to use or chose to use in the project to achieve the desired outcomes.
Finally, I tried my best to make the game as close as I wanted but did not know how to do everything I wanted. I got it to have sounds and music, and visually nice with a goal to reach to win. In order to win this you need patience and timing.

UX and UI design goals.

My user experience goal with this project is to try make a game that has ease of use to play, with practical game controls so that the user can learn how to play quickly and not get frustrated or have a negative experience playing the game due to bad game control layout. I wanted to make a fun to play game that makes the user want to return and play again and again due to the ability to learn the timing of the enemies in the game to make it feel easy but tricky too. The game uses sprites and 2D graphics which would appeal to retro gamers and players who are used to playing older style games. Being the first game I ever made, 3D is out of the question for now. I wanted to make a game that evokes a positive response from the player due to the responsive gameplay, sounds and controls. I also thought it would be good to use appropriate colours to make it visually stimulating and nice to look at. It was also important to make sure that there were no bugs in the code as the user might have a bad UX if the game did not work properly and they lost the game as a result or worse the game crashed. In terms of avoiding that, I tried to consider defensive coding methods like making the background green in case the picture did not load on a different browser. Another goal of this is to be playable by most ages of people ideally and not too hard.

Testing

 For testing I ran the code in google chrome and used developer tools to help make code work.
 Tested left and right controls for player until desired outcome.
 Tested collisions between player,enemies and goal worked.
 Tested game to make sure all sound effects and music worked without problems
 Tested to make sure messages showed up when you lose or win.
 Tested to make sure sprites loaded correctly.
 Tessted to make sure background loaded.
 Tested to see if it was possible to win the game. It is possible just need to get the timing right.
 Tested links to game work and that game runs.

Deployment

Website was coded in vscode. I used Git command line to do a git init, git add to add all files, commit and message to commit files throughout the development and push them from the local repository on my laptop to the remote repository on github. It was coded with HTML5 canvas, CSS3, Vanilla Javascript, background from free google images, sounds chosen from zapslpat.com, sprites made on piskel, then I saved the documents on my laptop and then uploaded to GITHUB via git command line into a remote repository from my local repository for the last time for assessment. Prior deployment I was given advice from my peers on Slack if I was stuck, search the web to find a solution and given advice at the start, middle and end by my mentor. It is deployed at the link above.

Image---------
Got the image for the background from (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/a3/d7/87a3d72be088b61a25988f4b92132975.jpg).

Sounds---------
Got alien sounds at https://www.zapsplat.com/?s=aliens&post_type=music&sound-effect-category-id= . It is the second sound under Machines and Equipment.
The tractor sound is at https://www.zapsplat.com/?s=tractor&post_type=music&sound-effect-category-id= and is called tractor pass by.
The Background music is royalty free and at https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/bluegrass-and-hillbilly/ it is called Looking Back Over The Hill (Instrumental Version) – Bluegrass instruments (banjo, fiddle...

Sprites-------
Made my own sprites at piskel.com and they are found at https://www.piskelapp.com/user/6608205050806272.

Conclusion----
I was satisfied I met the outcomes but hope my skills get better so that I might be able to make the sprites animated and the difficulty increase. I did try to add extra levels and animated sprites but given my limited ability at the time I was unable to succeed. But given it was my first game and I did use a framework to make the game I am happy with my first game.
